ROW,invariant,NON-ACTUATION,
  "NEUROPRINT-VIEW is a pure projection. It MUST NOT mutate or propose
   changes to CapabilityState, ConsentState, BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec,
   RoH models, ReversalConditions, PolicyStack, or any hardware driver."

ROW,invariant,LOG-ONLY,
  "NEUROPRINT-VIEW records MAY be appended into .evolve.jsonl and
   hash-linked via .donutloop.aln. Standalone writable ledgers for
   neuroprint! are forbidden."
