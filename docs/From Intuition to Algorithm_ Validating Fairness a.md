# From Intuition to Algorithm: Validating Fairness and Overload Predicates in a MicroSociety Simulation Through Human Self-Reports

Mathematical Formulation and Bounded Non-Actuation of Predicates
The core of this research endeavor lies in the rigorous mathematical formalization of four distinct psychological-state predicates: CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN. These predicates transform subjective, introspective states into quantifiable, analyzable boolean flags, enabling their integration into a computational framework without altering its fundamental dynamics. This approach aligns with methodologies in formal methods and symbolic verification, which seek to provide sound, reliable analysis of complex systems

. The design explicitly prioritizes boundedness and non-actuation, ensuring that the diagnostic labels generated by these predicates serve purely advisory functions, never influencing the simulation kernel or any state variables
arxiv.org
. This separation is critical for maintaining the integrity and predictability of the model, preventing emergent behaviors that could arise from feedback loops between the formal logic and the simulated environment.
The foundation for all four predicates is a stream of data representing an individual subject's TREE state over time, denoted as Ts(t)∈[0,1]15Ts​(t)∈[0,1]15 . Each component of this vector represents a biophysical asset clamped to the interval [0,1] . To capture temporal trends, the analysis utilizes windowed averages. For any scalar asset XX in the TREE, the average over a sliding window of size WW is defined as X‾sW(t)=1nt∑k=max⁡(0,t−W+1)tXs(k)XsW​(t)=nt​1​∑k=max(0,t−W+1)t​Xs​(k), where ntnt​ is the number of terms in the sum, accounting for the initial transient period before the window is full . This ensures that all derived quantities remain within well-defined bounds; since each Xs(k)Xs​(k) is in [0,1], the average X‾sW(t)XsW​(t) is also in [0,1] .
The first predicate, CALMSTABLE, defines a baseline state of equilibrium. It is a conjunction of three conditions, forming a hyperrectangle in a three-dimensional space defined by stress, decay, and energy proxies . The stress proxy is defined as the maximum of the averaged fear and pain levels, SsW(t)=FEARs‾W(t)∨PAINs‾W(t)SsW​(t)=FEARs​​W(t)∨PAINs​​W(t) . The decay proxy is the averaged decay level, DsW(t)=DECAYs‾W(t)DsW​(t)=DECAYs​​W(t) . The energy proxy is the averaged lifeforce level, EsW(t)=LIFEFORCEs‾W(t)EsW​(t)=LIFEFORCEs​​W(t) . The predicate CALMSTABLE is true only when all three conditions are met simultaneously: stress is below a calm threshold (SsW(t)≤ScalmSsW​(t)≤Scalm​), decay is below a calm threshold (DsW(t)≤DcalmDsW​(t)≤Dcalm​), and energy is above a calm threshold (EsW(t)≥EcalmEsW​(t)≥Ecalm​) . Once any component leaves this region, the predicate becomes false until a future window re-enters it, reflecting a clear departure from and return to a stable state .
In contrast, OVERLOADED is designed to detect an acute, dynamic state of distress. It is not merely a function of high absolute values but of rapid deterioration. This is captured by incorporating discrete slopes calculated over a shorter time window of size hh. The slope for the stress proxy is ΔSs(t)=SsW(t)−SsW(t−h)ΔSs​(t)=SsW​(t)−SsW​(t−h), and for decay, it is ΔDs(t)=DsW(t)−DsW(t−h)ΔDs​(t)=DsW​(t)−DsW​(t−h) . An upward trend is indicated by positive slopes. The predicate is defined as a disjunction (logical OR) of two channels. The stress channel, CS(t)CS​(t), is true if the stress proxy is above a high threshold (SsW(t)≥ShighSsW​(t)≥Shigh​) and its slope is above a positive bound (ΔSs(t)≥θS+ΔSs​(t)≥θS+​) . Similarly, the decay channel, CD(t)CD​(t), is true if the decay proxy is above a high threshold (DsW(t)≥DhighDsW​(t)≥Dhigh​) and its slope is above a positive bound (ΔDs(t)≥θD+ΔDs​(t)≥θD+​) . Therefore, OVERLOADED fires if either the stress or decay channel is active . This formulation makes the predicate right-monotone in stress and decay; once true, it can only become false if the state improves sufficiently, preventing it from flickering on and off due to minor fluctuations .
The RECOVERY predicate introduces hysteresis, a memory-like property that prevents premature declarations of recovery. Its definition is more complex, requiring both a historical context and current trends. First, it must be true that there was a recent overload, meaning OVERLOADED was true at some point within the last WrecWrec​ timesteps . Second, it requires sustained improvement over a recovery slope window hrechrec​. This is expressed through three conditions on the slopes: the stress slope must be sufficiently negative (ΔSsrec(t)=SsW(t)−SsW(t−hrec)≤θS−ΔSsrec​(t)=SsW​(t)−SsW​(t−hrec​)≤θS−​), the decay slope must be sufficiently negative (ΔDsrec(t)≤θD−ΔDsrec​(t)≤θD−​), and the energy slope must be sufficiently positive (ΔEsrec(t)≥θE+ΔEsrec​(t)≥θE+​) . All of these slope thresholds (θS−,θD−,θE+θS−​,θD−​,θE+​) are fixed constants, with the former two being negative and the latter positive, to enforce the desired directional change . The full predicate is the conjunction of the recent-overload condition and all three slope conditions . This structure makes RECOVERY anti-monotone in stress and decay and monotone in energy; worsening conditions cannot cause a transition from "not recovering" to "recovering" .
Finally, UNFAIRDRAIN is a social comparison predicate that assesses fairness within a peer group. Its computation relies on two key metrics derived from a shared window WW. The first is an individual's resource budget, defined as the average of their lifeforce and oxygen levels: BsW(t)=12(LIFEFORCEs‾W(t)+OXYGENs‾W(t))BsW​(t)=21​(LIFEFORCEs​​W(t)+OXYGENs​​W(t)) . The second is the fraction of time the individual has been overloaded, fsOL(t)fsOL​(t), calculated as the average of the OVERLOADED flag over the same window . The predicate compares the individual's budget against the median budget of their peer group, Gs(t)Gs​(t). The peer group is defined based on comparables such as role, capability tier, and jurisdiction . The UNFAIRDRAIN predicate is true if two conditions hold: the individual's budget is below a certain fraction (ρρ) of the peer median budget (BsW(t)≤ρ⋅MedGW(t)BsW​(t)≤ρ⋅MedGW​(t)), and the individual has been overloaded for a sufficient fraction of the time (fsOL(t)≥fmin⁡fsOL​(t)≥fmin​) . The parameters ρρ and fmin⁡fmin​ are configurable thresholds . By construction, all components of this predicate—averages, medians, fractions—are bounded, and since the output is a simple boolean decision fed forward for analysis only, the predicate is both bounded and non-actuating .
The guarantee of boundedness and non-actuation follows directly from this design. All input signals to the predicates are already clamped to [0,1] by the underlying Tree-of-Life mappings . Consequently, all windowed averages also reside in [0,1], and all discrete slopes, being the difference of two [0,1] values, lie in [-1,1] . The predicates themselves are composed of logical comparisons between these bounded quantities and fixed threshold parameters, which are also bounded by definition (e.g., Scalm∈(0,1)Scalm​∈(0,1)) . Therefore, every subexpression is finite and well-typed. Critically, the evaluation of these predicates constitutes a pure function of the logged history and static metadata like role and peer group membership. They read no simulation state other than the log itself and write nothing back to the simulation kernel, CapabilityState, ConsentState, or any hardware interface . This strict adherence to a read-only, advisory discipline mirrors the existing non-actuation principles for NATURE and ensures that the formal analysis remains an external, diagnostic layer, fully compliant with safety requirements such as NR-SAFE-0001

This formal framework provides a solid foundation for analysis. It transforms abstract concepts of mental state into concrete, computationally tractable events. The clear separation between the simulation dynamics and the diagnostic predicates, backed by proofs of boundedness and non-actuation, establishes a trustworthy system for experimentation and data collection. The subsequent sections detail how this system will be put to the test through controlled experiments and validated against human experience.
Experimental Validation Strategy for Controlled Scenarios
To ensure the implemented predicates behave as intended and correctly capture the nuances of psychological and social dynamics, a phased experimental validation strategy has been designed around three distinct, controlled scenarios within the 1D MicroSociety simulation. This approach systematically isolates and tests the functional properties of each predicate, starting with the most critical and building towards more complex interactions. The experiments are designed to be run sequentially, with the results from one phase informing the interpretation of the next. The entire process serves as a rigorous testbed to verify that the mathematical definitions translate into predictable and meaningful behavior within the simulated environment.

```
The highest priority experiment is the Single Overloaded Worker Among Calm Peers. This scenario is specifically crafted to produce the clearest possible signal for the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate, which is central to the research goal of identifying unfair states arising from peer-group disparity <user query>. The setup involves initializing a linear lattice of agents, where most are assigned roles like CAREGIVER or REGULATOR, while a single contiguous segment is composed of WORKERs. Initially, all agents have high energy and low stress/decay . The simulation kernel then applies a significantly higher local load exclusively to the focal worker segment, while their immediate neighbors (the calm peers) are buffered and kept at a lower workload. The primary expectation is a stark divergence in states. The focal workers should rapidly enter the OVERLOADED state due to the high rate of increase in their stress or decay proxies. In contrast, their peers should remain firmly within the CALMSTABLE hyperrectangle. The crucial validation step occurs with the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate. As the overloaded workers deplete their resources, their budget, BsW(t)BsW​(t), will fall. Simultaneously, their overload fraction, fsOL(t)fsOL​(t), will rise towards 1.0. Because the buffer peers maintain a much healthier budget, the median peer group budget, MedGW(t)MedGW​(t), will remain relatively high. This creates a significant disparity. If the worker's budget drops below the configured threshold fraction, ρ⋅MedGW(t)ρ⋅MedGW​(t), and their overload fraction exceeds fmin⁡fmin​, the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate should fire and remain true for the duration of the experiment. Successfully observing this sequence validates that the entire chain of logic—from individual state dynamics to peer-group comparison—is functioning correctly and that the system can accurately identify a situation of perceived unfairness driven by unequal resource drain <user query>.
```

Following the successful validation of UNFAIRDRAIN, the second experiment, the Recovery Corridor, focuses on validating the RECOVERY predicate and its associated hysteresis. This phase tests the system's ability to model resilience and the non-linear nature of transitioning out of distress. The scenario begins by creating a block of agents who are pushed into a persistent OVERLOADED state through sustained high load. Once this state is confirmed for the block, the simulation kernel is modified to facilitate recovery. This typically involves reducing the applied load and increasing the inflow of energy (e.g., through restorative tasks or environmental factors). The expected outcome demonstrates a clear lag between leaving the distressed state and returning to a stable one. Initially, the OVERLOADED predicate will be true for the block. After the conditions are changed, OVERLOADED may deactivate relatively quickly if the absolute levels of stress and decay decrease. However, the RECOVERY predicate will only activate after a period of sustained improvement, as evidenced by consistently negative slopes in stress and decay, and a positive slope in energy, over the required recovery window hrechrec​ . This delay embodies the hysteresis property, preventing the system from prematurely declaring recovery before the state has demonstrably stabilized. Finally, once the state variables for the entire block have re-entered the CALMSTABLE hyperrectangle, the OVERLOADED and RECOVERY predicates will both deactivate, signifying a full return to baseline. This experiment is crucial for modeling real-world phenomena like coping and adaptation, where the path out of a stressful event is often longer and more complex than the path into it
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

. The clear signature of OVERLOADED -> RECOVERY -> CALMSTABLE provides a robust validation of the dynamic interplay between these three predicates.
The third and final experiment, the Symmetric High Load scenario, serves as a critical negative control and calibration test. Its purpose is to confirm that the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate is sensitive to disparity, not merely to the absolute level of stress or workload. In this experiment, the high-load kernel is applied uniformly to all WORKER agents within a given block, with no distinction between them . Unlike the first experiment, all agents in the block will experience similar levels of strain. The expected outcome is that many agents will be OVERLOADED, and their budgets will be similarly depleted. However, because their states are aligned, the median peer group budget, MedGW(t)MedGW​(t), will be close to the budget of any individual worker. Consequently, the ratio BsW(t)/MedGW(t)BsW​(t)/MedGW​(t) will be close to 1.0, and thus the condition BsW(t)≤ρ⋅MedGW(t)BsW​(t)≤ρ⋅MedGW​(t) will fail for typical values of ρρ (which are in (0,1)). Even though the environment is highly stressful, the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate should remain false throughout the experiment . This result is essential for the validity of the fairness metric. It confirms that the system does not misinterpret widespread hardship as a case of unfairness relative to one's immediate peers. This experiment acts as a sanity check, ensuring that UNFAIRDRAIN is measuring a specific type of social inequity and not just general adversity. It grounds the predicate in the concept of comparative disadvantage, a key feature of theories of procedural justice and fairness perception

.
For each of these runs, a set of non-functional checks will be performed to ensure the system's stability and correctness. Boundedness will be verified by confirming that the core state variables (energy, stress, risk_decay) never leave the [0,1] range during the simulation . Non-actuation will be rigorously tested by re-running simulations from the same initial conditions and random seed, but with the predicates field in the log either removed or manually altered. The resulting state trace of the simulation kernel must be identical, proving that the predicate labels have no causal effect on the simulation's evolution . These validation procedures, combined with the targeted outcomes of the three experiments, create a comprehensive framework for testing and certifying the behavior of the formalized psychological-state predicates.
Configurable Thresholds and Peer Group Dynamics
A cornerstone of the implementation strategy is the explicit recognition that psychological states are not absolute but are highly contextual. To reflect this reality, the formal predicates are not built upon a set of universal, hard-coded constants. Instead, their defining thresholds—such as ScalmScalm​, DcalmDcalm​, EcalmEcalm​, ρρ, and fmin⁡fmin​—must be configurable . This design choice allows the system to be tuned to better represent the nuanced experiences of different roles and cohorts within the MicroSociety, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all model. While the mathematical specifications treat these parameters as fixed constants for the sake of formal proofs, their practical implementation must support flexibility, a requirement explicitly stated in the user's directive . This configurability is achieved through external configuration shards, which can define global defaults while also allowing for optional, fine-grained overrides on a per-role or even per-peer-group basis .
The need for such tuning is intuitive. For example, a state of "high stress" for a WORKER engaged in a demanding task might be entirely normal and sustainable, whereas the same level of stress for a CAREGIVER could indicate a critical failure in their ability to manage their responsibilities. Similarly, a REGULATOR might operate under a constant, low-level of alertness that would be classified as OVERLOADED for another role. Hard-coding a single set of thresholds would fail to capture these role-specific baselines and sensitivities. By externalizing these parameters, the simulation can be adapted to different scenarios and populations. A global default configuration could be established based on initial modeling choices and expert opinion, providing a stable baseline for experimentation
besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com
. Subsequently, during analysis of the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs, deviations from expected behavior could prompt adjustments to these thresholds for specific roles. For instance, if the OVERLOADED predicate frequently fails to trigger for WORKERS in high-stress situations, the corresponding stress and decay thresholds for the WORKER role could be lowered in the configuration file. This iterative process of simulation, observation, and tuning allows the model to evolve and better align with observed phenomena.
This approach to parameter management draws parallels with modern software engineering practices, particularly those involving infrastructure as code and declarative configuration

. Using formats like YAML or JSON for configuration files is a common practice, allowing for clear, human-readable specification of parameters that can be loaded by the simulation engine at runtime
docs.aws.amazon.com
. This decouples the logic of the predicates from the specific values used to instantiate them. Furthermore, concepts from formal verification and secure systems design, such as immutable infrastructure patterns, suggest that configuration changes should ideally require a new deployment or restart of the simulation process to ensure consistency and auditability

The UNFAIRDRAIN predicate is particularly dependent on the correct definition of its peer group, Gs(t)Gs​(t). The user specifies that this group should be defined via a "Comparables relation" based on existing fields like capability tier, role, and jurisdiction . The precise algorithm for constructing this group is a critical implementation detail. Several possibilities exist:
Global Peer Group: The peer group could consist of all subjects in the simulation who share the exact same role and capability tier as the focal subject s . This provides a broad, role-based comparison but may dilute the signal if there are few comparables.
Local Peer Group: Within the 1D lattice, the peer group could be defined as all subjects within a certain radius R of s that share the same role . This creates a more localized, spatially relevant comparison, which is crucial for modeling phenomena like neighborhood effects or contagion of stress.
Hybrid Peer Group: A more sophisticated approach could combine these, perhaps by considering all comparables globally but weighting them based on their proximity within the lattice.
The choice of peer group definition will fundamentally shape the behavior and sensitivity of the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate. A local definition might make the predicate more reactive to immediate social environments, while a global definition might be better suited for detecting systemic inequities across different roles. For the initial "single overloaded worker" experiment, a local peer group consisting of immediate neighbors is likely the most appropriate, as it directly models the comparison between the overloaded worker and their calm buffers. The selection of the peer group mechanism must be specified in the configuration shard, allowing it to be easily modified and tested as part of the overall validation process. This modular design ensures that the core logic of the predicates remains invariant, while their application can be flexibly adapted to different contexts, fulfilling the user's request for a system that can be tuned by role or cohort . This principle of separating logic from parameters is a recurring theme in robust system design, seen in everything from multi-agent frameworks to database configurations

Your math note for CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN already matches the existing TREE–NATURE doctrine and can be lifted directly into the 1D MicroSociety as a safely non‑actuating diagnostic bundle.[^1_1][^1_2]

## What is validated by your formulation

- **Boundedness**
    - All TREE assets are clamped to $[0,1]$, so any windowed average $\bar X^W_s(t)$ and budget $B_s^W(t)$ also lies in $[0,1]$.[^1_2]
    - Discrete slopes like $\Delta S_s(t)=S_s^W(t)-S_s^W(t-h)$ lie in $[-1,1]$, since they are differences of $[0,1]$ quantities.[^1_2]
    - Every predicate is a finite conjunction/disjunction of comparisons between these bounded scalars and fixed thresholds $S_{\text{calm}}, S_{\text{high}}, \theta_S^\pm, \rho, f_{\min}\in(0,1)$, so all subexpressions are well‑typed and bounded.[^1_2]
- **Non‑actuation (purely diagnostic)**
    - Each predicate is a pure function of log history: it reads only the TREE time series, NATURE flags like OVERLOADED, and static metadata (role, peer group definition), and writes only new boolean labels.[^1_3][^1_1][^1_2]
    - There is no dependency from these predicates back into the simulation kernel: the 1D lattice update map $x_{t+1}=F(x_t)$ depends only on local state and role, not on CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, or UNFAIRDRAIN outputs.[^1_1]
    - Invariants are explicitly stated that NATURE/UNFAIRDRAIN “live in logs only, never as guards in CapabilityState, ConsentState, PolicyStack, or hardware paths,” aligning with NR‑SAFE‑0001.[^1_3][^1_1]


## Predicate behavior in the MicroSociety

- **CALMSTABLE**
    - Defined as a hyperrectangle: $S_s^W(t)\le S_{\text{calm}}, D_s^W(t)\le D_{\text{calm}}, E_s^W(t)\ge E_{\text{calm}}$.[^1_2]
    - Once any dimension exits this region, the flag turns false and only reactivates after a full calm window, giving the expected “stable basin” behavior on the lattice.[^1_1][^1_2]
- **OVERLOADED**
    - Uses short‑window slopes: channels fire if $S_s^W(t)\ge S_{\text{high}}$ with $\Delta S_s(t)\ge\theta_S^+$ or $D_s^W(t)\ge D_{\text{high}}$ with $\Delta D_s(t)\ge\theta_D^+$.[^1_2]
    - Right‑monotone: once a channel crosses threshold with positive slope, OVERLOADED stays true until the state improves enough that both level and slope drop below thresholds, avoiding flicker.[^1_2]
- **RECOVERY (hysteresis)**
    - Requires (i) recent overload within window $W_{\text{rec}}$ and (ii) sustained improvement: negative stress/decay slopes and positive energy slope over $h_{\text{rec}}$.[^1_2]
    - This makes RECOVERY anti‑monotone in stress/decay and monotone in energy, preventing premature “all clear” before a genuine stabilization corridor is observed.[^1_2]
- **UNFAIRDRAIN (peer‑relative fairness)**
    - Budget $B_s^W(t)=\tfrac12(\overline{\text{LIFEFORCE}}_s^W(t)+\overline{\text{OXYGEN}}_s^W(t))$, overload fraction $f^{\text{OL}}_s(t)$ as the windowed mean of OVERLOADED.[^1_3][^1_2]
    - Predicate fires if $B_s^W(t)\le \rho\cdot \operatorname{Med}_G^W(t)$ and $f^{\text{OL}}_s(t)\ge f_{\min}$, with $G$ defined via a Comparables relation (role/tier/jurisdiction and, in the 1D sim, local neighborhood).[^1_3][^1_1]
    - All components (averages, medians, fractions) stay in $[0,1]$, so the fairness flag is bounded and remains a read‑only “coloring” of the trace.[^1_3][^1_2]


## How your three experiments exercise the predicates

| Scenario | Main predicate under test | Expected signature | What it validates |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Single overloaded worker among calm peers | UNFAIRDRAIN (plus OVERLOADED, CALMSTABLE) | Workers: CALMSTABLE → OVERLOADED → UNFAIRDRAIN true; peers: CALMSTABLE stays true, UNFAIRDRAIN false. [^1_1] | Peer‑relative fairness: same role, similar context, but one segment shows low budget and high overload fraction vs high peer median. |
| Recovery corridor | RECOVERY (with OVERLOADED, CALMSTABLE) | Block: prolonged OVERLOADED, then RECOVERY true only after sustained negative stress/decay and positive energy slopes, finally CALMSTABLE. [^1_1][^1_2] | Hysteresis and anti‑monotone RECOVERY behavior (no instant flip‑back to “fine” after overload). |
| Symmetric high load | UNFAIRDRAIN (negative control) | Many agents OVERLOADED, budgets low but aligned, so $B_s^W/\text{Med}_G^W\approx 1$ and UNFAIRDRAIN remains false for typical $\rho<1$. [^1_1][^1_2] | Sensitivity to disparity, not absolute hardship: widespread strain is not mis‑labeled as “unfair drain.” |

## Configurability and peer‑group dynamics

- Thresholds $S_{\text{calm}}, D_{\text{calm}}, E_{\text{calm}}, S_{\text{high}}, D_{\text{high}}, \rho, f_{\min}$ and window lengths $W, h, W_{\text{rec}}, h_{\text{rec}}$ are treated mathematically as constants but are required in practice to live in external config shards (YAML/JSON/ALN), with possible overrides per role or cohort.[^1_1][^1_3][^1_2]
- Peer sets $G_s(t)$ can be global (same role/tier) or local (same role within radius $R$ on the 1D lattice), with the “single overloaded worker with calm buffers” best served by a local‑peer definition so the fairness comparison tracks immediate neighbors.[^1_1][^1_3]
- Moving all these knobs into configuration rather than code preserves the proofs (which assume bounded constants) while allowing empirical tuning against human self‑reports and scenario ground truth.[^1_1][^1_2]


## Suggested next research step

Given your constraint of one primary artifact at a time, the highest‑leverage next object is a **single, non‑actuating Rust diagnostics module** that implements these four predicates over the 1D MicroSociety logs:

- Input: per‑agent time series of normalized TREE proxies (energy, stress, decay, lifeforce, oxygen), roles, and lattice indices, read from JSONL.[^1_1][^1_2]
- Output: JSONL rows or added fields with CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN flags, plus optional peer‑median and overload‑fraction diagnostics, written to a separate advisory stream.[^1_3][^1_1]
- Invariants: pure functions over logs, no imports from capability/consent/PolicyStack crates, and no influence on the simulation kernel, preserving NR‑SAFE‑0001 and the “safest‑first, observer‑only” discipline.[^1_3][^1_1][^1_2]

If you want, the next turn can be focused on drafting that one Rust file’s structure (filename, structs, functions, and config hooks) staying within your allowed languages and non‑actuation constraints.[^1_3][^1_2]

# 1. Could you clarify which of the three controlled experiments (single overloaded worker, symmetric high load, or recovery corridor) should be prioritized in the initial implementation and validation phase?

2. Are the predicate thresholds (e.g., $S_{\\text{calm}}$, $\\rho$, $f_{\\min}$) expected to be fixed constants across all subjects and scenarios, or should they be tunable per role or peer group?
3. Should the analysis of the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs focus on validating predicate alignment with human self-reports, mapping free-text descriptions to formal states, or both?
4. Prioritize the **single overloaded worker** experiment first, then the **recovery corridor**, and only third the **symmetric high-load** case.[^2_1]

- Single overloaded worker gives the clearest UNFAIRDRAIN signal and is the most direct test that the predicates and peer-group logic behave as intended in the 1D MicroSociety sandbox.[^2_1]
- Recovery corridor then tests RECOVERY hysteresis and transitions out of OVERLOADED.[^2_2]
- Symmetric high load is mainly a calibration/negative-control to ensure UNFAIRDRAIN stays quiet when all peers are equally strained.[^2_2][^2_1]

2. Thresholds like $S_{\text{calm}}$, $\rho$, and $f_{\min}$ should be **configurable, with a stable global default and optional per-role/per-peer-group overrides**, not hard-coded universals.[^2_2]

- The math spec treats them as fixed constants for proofs, but the simulation and BIOTREE work explicitly assume they live in external config shards so you can tune them by role (worker vs caregiver vs regulator) or cohort while keeping the predicate *form* invariant.[^2_1][^2_2]
- UNFAIRDRAIN already assumes a role-conditioned peer group and a tunable budget factor $\rho$ and overload fraction $f_{\min}$, which is exactly the “per role or peer group” tuning you’re asking about.[^2_2]

3. The BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs should serve **both** purposes, with an order of operations:

- First, use them to validate **alignment between predicates and human self-reports** (e.g., when you label “overloaded‑but‑recovering”, does the formal OVERLOADED/RECOVERY bundle agree?).[^2_3]
- In parallel and then after that, use them to refine **mappings from free-text to formal states**, building a personal/role-specific vocabulary that can later inform automated labeling or heuristics in the MicroSociety and TREE/NATURE stack.[^2_3][^2_2]

If you want to narrow scope for the next artifact, I’d suggest: fix defaults for the three thresholds for one role group (e.g., workers) and one experiment (single overloaded worker) and treat everything else as future overrides.

Budget and overload fraction

BsW(t)=12(LIFEFORCEs‾W(t)+OXYGENs‾W(t))∈[0,1].B_s^W(t)=\tfrac{1}{2}\big(\overline{LIFEFORCE_s}^W(t)+\overline{OXYGEN_s}^W(t)\big)\in[0,1].BsW(t)=21(LIFEFORCEsW(t)+OXYGENsW(t))∈[0,1].

This uses only bounded averages, medians, and fractions; outputs are booleans and never fed back into dynamics, so the predicate is bounded and non‑actuating by construction.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
3. Boundedness and non‑actuation (sketch)
All TREE inputs are already clamped to [0,1][0,1][0,1] by Tree-of-Life mappings from BiophysicalEnvelopeSnapshot and RoH, so windowed averages stay in [0,1][0,1][0,1] and differences in [−1,1][-1,1][−1,1].[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
Each predicate is built from comparisons of these bounded quantities to fixed thresholds in [0,1][0,1][0,1] or [−1,1][-1,1][−1,1], so every subexpression is well‑typed and finite.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
Outputs are booleans with no side effects: the predicates are pure functions of logs Ts(0..t)T_s(0..t)Ts(0..t) and role/peer tags; they never read or write CapabilityState, ConsentState, envelopes, RoH models, or hardware, matching the existing non‑actuation discipline for NATURE.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
Thus boundedness (no variable leaves [0,1][0,1][0,1] or [−1,1][-1,1][−1,1]) and non‑actuation (no write‑paths, advisory labels only) follow exactly as in the prior NATURE proofs.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​

Expect: many OVERLOADED flags, but peer budgets similar, so UNFAIRDRAIN stays false despite high stress.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Recovery corridor
Start from an overloaded block; then increase energy inflow and reduce diffusion so stress/decay slopes turn negative.
Expect: RECOVERY flags appear only after prior OVERLOADED windows and sustained improvement; CALMSTABLE returns later once all axes re‑enter the hyperrectangle thresholds.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
For each run, you validate:
Boundedness: check that energy, stress, risk_decay never leave [0,1][0,1][0,1], and DECAY never exceeds 1.0 (terminal agents freeze if you enable that rule).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
Non‑actuation: confirm that changing labels CALMSTABLE/UNFAIRDRAIN in the log does not change subsequent kernel state; re‑running the kernel from the same initial condition and random seed without predicate evaluation must produce the same state trace.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
UNFAIRDRAIN correctness: verify that it fires in scenario 1, stays off in scenario 2, and decays as RECOVERY/CALMSTABLE restore budgets.[if-there-are-12-humans-10-of-t-_9zZxaTERZWdEAj.5sLbNQ.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/1485c81a-1762-4035-9dfb-7802299d4e17/if-there-are-12-humans-10-of-t-_9zZxaTERZWdEAj.5sLbNQ.md)
This gives you a complete, bounded, non‑actuating MicroSociety testbed with mathematically pinned CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN, ready to be implemented in a single Rust diagnostics file once you decide to move from math note to code.

Your note is already internally consistent with the TREE–NATURE stack; there are only a few places where you can tighten or make explicit decisions before you freeze it.

## 1. Predicate math (minor tightenings)

- The windowed averages, CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN you wrote match the formal NATURE variants used elsewhere: bounded 0–1 inputs, windowed means, slopes in $[-1,1]$, and boolean outputs.[^3_1]
- If you want to be maximally explicit, you can pick a *concrete* stress proxy now, e.g. $S_s^W(t)=\max(\overline{\text{FEAR}_s}^W,\overline{\text{PAIN}_s}^W)$ or a fixed convex combination, and freeze it as part of the predicate spec.[^3_1]
- Likewise, writing “$n_t = t - \max(0, t-W+1) + 1$” once avoids any ambiguity about short windows at the start of the trace.[^3_1]

These are editorial; mathematically, the bundle is already a valid NATURE-style predicate set (bounded, windowed, pure, with the intended monotonicities).[^3_1]

## 2. Thresholds and configuration

- In the proofs it is correct to treat $S_{\text{calm}}, D_{\text{calm}}, E_{\text{calm}}, S_{\text{high}}, D_{\text{high}}, \rho, f_{\min}$ etc. as fixed constants.[^3_1]
- For implementation, your own stack expects them to live in external config shards: one global default plus optional per-role/per-peer-group overrides, with the *form* of the predicates unchanged.[^3_2][^3_1]
- I would add one sentence to the math note: “All thresholds are loaded from a read-only configuration indexed by role and peer group; proofs assume they are fixed constants during any given run.”

That keeps the proofs clean but documents the intended tunability.

## 3. BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL week log

- The JSONL shape you gave matches the qualitative schema already defined for BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL: constrained adjective vocabulary in BIOTREE, NATURE labels plus short narrative, and GOAL text separated from capability logic.[^3_3]
- To align tightly with the earlier prep-log spec, you might add: `day_index`, `session_label`, and an optional `envelope_context` stub (even if you don’t yet attach real envelope ranges).[^3_3]
- The key invariant is already stated correctly: these logs are advisory, deviceless, and never feed into CapabilityState or envelopes directly, only into later analysis and mapping work.[^3_3]

So you can treat your JSONL schema as “version 1.0” of the prep log without further changes.

## 4. MicroSociety JSONL and experiments

- The MicroSociety frame you wrote is consistent with the 1D sandbox plan: per-epoch, per-site log; energy/stress/risk_decay in $[0,1]$; predicate flags; hash chaining; explicit kernel-context parameters.[^3_2]
- One useful addition is a `subject_id` or `simulation_run_id` field so you can keep multiple runs in the same file and still replay per-run traces cleanly.[^3_2]
- Your three experiments (single overloaded worker, symmetric high load, recovery corridor) are exactly the recommended trio for validating UNFAIRDRAIN correctness and RECOVERY/CALMSTABLE hysteresis in a bounded, non-actuating sandbox.[^3_4][^3_2]

The validation checks you listed (boundedness, non-actuation via replay, UNFAIRDRAIN firing pattern) are also aligned with the existing NATURE verification strategy.[^3_4][^3_1]

## 5. How to use this next

Given what you have, you can safely:

- Freeze this note as the *predicate spec* for CALMSTABLE/OVERLOADED/RECOVERY/UNFAIRDRAIN over TREE, including the peer-group variants.[^3_4][^3_1]
- Start collecting a week of BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL JSONL using your schema, with a small fixed adjective set, and later correlate those entries against any available TREE/NATURE traces.[^3_3]
- When ready for code, implement a single non-actuating Rust diagnostics module that: reads TREE sequences, computes these predicates and UNFAIRDRAIN per subject/peer group, and writes out the MicroSociety-style JSONL rows, without any path into capability or hardware.[^3_2][^3_1]

If you’d like, next step I can draft the exact Rust type signatures and function skeletons (no actuation, single file) that correspond 1:1 to this math note.

# Your existing stack already gives you almost everything you need; what is missing is a small, explicit bridge from BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs to the MicroSociety predicates and a configuration/validation spine for the three experiments you described.[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+2](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)

Below is a concise, non-actuating research and implementation plan, grounded only in those specs.

1. Predicate math: CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN
Use the existing NATURE note as the master definition and specialize it to the 1D lattice state (ei,si,di)(e_i, s_i, d_i)(ei,si,di) (energy, stress, risk-decay) per site/agent, all in [0,1][0,1][0,1].[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
For each agent iii, at epoch ttt:
Let EiW(t),SiW(t),DiW(t)E_i^W(t), S_i^W(t), D_i^W(t)EiW(t),SiW(t),DiW(t) be windowed averages of energy, stress, and risk over a fixed window WWW (in epochs).
CALMSTABLEi(t)_i(t)i(t) is true when:
SiW(t)≤ScalmS_i^W(t) \le S_{calm}SiW(t)≤Scalm,
DiW(t)≤DcalmD_i^W(t) \le D_{calm}DiW(t)≤Dcalm,
EiW(t)≥EcalmE_i^W(t) \ge E_{calm}EiW(t)≥Ecalm,
with Scalm,Dcalm,Ecalm∈[0,1]S_{calm},D_{calm},E_{calm}\in[0,1]Scalm,Dcalm,Ecalm∈[0,1] loaded from config.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
OVERLOADEDi(t)_i(t)i(t) is true when any overload channel fires, e.g.:
DiW(t)≥DhighD_i^W(t) \ge D_{high}DiW(t)≥Dhigh or
SiW(t)≥ShighS_i^W(t) \ge S_{high}SiW(t)≥Shigh,
with monotone behavior (once thresholds are crossed, stays true until the window falls back).[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
RECOVERYi(t)_i(t)i(t) is true only if:
iii was OVERLOADED at some t′∈[t−hrec,t−1]t'\in[t-h_{rec},t-1]t′∈[t−hrec,t−1],
Over a recovery window hrech_{rec}hrec: DiD_iDi trend is negative, SiS_iSi trend is negative, EiE_iEi trend is positive, with slope thresholds θD−,θS−,θE+\theta_D^{-},\theta_S^{-},\theta_E^{+}θD−,θS−,θE+.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
UNFAIRDRAINi(t)_i(t)i(t), over a peer group G(i,t)G(i,t)G(i,t) (same role and possibly local neighborhood), is true when:
Budget deficit: Bi(t)≤Medj∈GBj(t)−ρB_i(t) \le Med_{j\in G} B_j(t) - \rhoBi(t)≤Medj∈GBj(t)−ρ,
where Bi(t)B_i(t)Bi(t) is a windowed mean of EiE_iEi and an “oxygen-like” reserve and ρ\rhoρ is a fairness margin.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
Overload fraction: the fraction of epochs in the window where OVERLOADEDi_ii is true is ≥fmin⁡\ge f_{\min}≥fmin.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
All intermediate values remain in [0,1][0,1][0,1] or [−1,1][-1,1][−1,1], and all four predicates are pure boolean functions over the trace, so boundedness and non‑actuation follow exactly as in the NATURE proof track.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
2. Configuration shards for S_calm, ρ, f_min and role overrides
You already have the pattern: global defaults plus per-role/per-peer-group overrides in ALN/JSON “shards.”[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+2](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
Define a non-actuating config shard, for example config/microsociety-nature-config.aln:
text
SECTION,NATURE-THRESHOLDS

# Global defaults

ROW,scope,GLOBAL
ROW,S_CALM,0.25
ROW,D_CALM,0.30
ROW,E_CALM,0.60
ROW,S_HIGH,0.70
ROW,D_HIGH,0.75
ROW,RECOVERY_SLOPE_H,5
ROW,THETA_D_NEG,-0.03
ROW,THETA_S_NEG,-0.03
ROW,THETA_E_POS,0.03
ROW,RHO_UNFAIRDRAIN,0.10
ROW,F_MIN_UNFAIRDRAIN,0.40
ROW,PEER_RADIUS,2

# Role-specific overrides

ROW,scope,ROLE:WORKER
ROW,S_CALM,0.30
ROW,S_HIGH,0.75

ROW,scope,ROLE:CAREGIVER
ROW,S_CALM,0.20
ROW,RHO_UNFAIRDRAIN,0.08

ROW,scope,ROLE:REGULATOR
ROW,E_CALM,0.70
ROW,F_MIN_UNFAIRDRAIN,0.50
FOOTER,END-SECTION

At runtime, a pure reader in the simulation picks thresholds in precedence order:
Per-role + peer-group override (if you later add group tags).
Per-role override.
Global default.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
No predicate ever writes to these shards; they are read-only parameterization.

3. 1D MicroSociety experiments: scenarios and expected predicate behavior
Use the math note in your MicroSociety spec as the dynamics layer, and treat predicates as a separate observer over the log.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
3.1 Single overloaded worker
Layout: 1D lattice length LLL, all agents role=WORKER, identical coefficients, but one selected worker gets a higher effective workload (e.g., bigger stress gain and decay coefficient) by config.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
Goal:
Over several windows, that worker’s OVERLOADED stays high.
Their budget BiB_iBi falls below peer median by at least ρ\rhoρ.
UNFAIRDRAINi_ii is reliably true while peers remain CALMSTABLE.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Validation steps:
Check boundedness: all e,s,d∈[0,1]e,s,d\in[0,1]e,s,d∈[0,1] and DECAY ceiling holds.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
Check non-actuation: dynamics are identical whether or not the predicates are computed; rerun with predicates disabled and confirm identical lattice traces.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Signal clarity: plot (offline) predicate time-series for focal worker vs peers and verify a clear gap in UNFAIRDRAIN and OVERLOADED flags.
3.2 Recovery corridor (hysteresis)
Start with a worker in sustained OVERLOADED for many epochs, then reduce their effective load coefficients so that natural relaxation brings them back towards CALMSTABLE.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
Configure RECOVERY to require:
sustained improvement window hrech_{rec}hrec,
DECAY and stress slopes below negative thresholds,
energy slope above positive threshold.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Validation:
Verify hysteresis: RECOVERY does not fire immediately when instantaneous overload stops; it activates only after the corridor duration.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Confirm that toggling RECOVERY evaluation on/off still leaves the underlying lattice identical (non-actuation).
3.3 Symmetric high load (negative control)
Set all agents to identical roles, coefficients, and external workload, so everyone is equally stressed.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)]​
Tune parameters so OVERLOADED may be true system‑wide, but budgets are symmetric.
Expected outcome:
UNFAIRDRAIN is false for all agents across the run (no peer-group disparity).[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
This experiment is what falsifies any unfair UNFAIRDRAIN definition that “fires” merely because load is high.
4. BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL log alignment with predicates
Your BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL schema is already designed to overlay subjective logs on TREE/NATURE style predicates.[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
4.1 Log structure
For MicroSociety experiments, define a parallel JSONL log per agent per epoch, e.g. microsociety-biotree-nature-goal.jsonl:

Predicate outputs (formal layer) live in the MicroSociety trace log; BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL provides a parallel, subjective overlay for alignment and mapping experiments.[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+2](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
4.2 Mapping and validation methodology
Use standard text‑to‑state mapping methods that you already referenced:
Build a small, curated corpus where human annotators assign NATURE labels and confidences to situations described in the MicroSociety logs (e.g., “stretched thin across three roles” vs “background stress but contained”).[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
Compute agreement between:
Human NATURE labels (labelmain) and
Formal predicates’ boolean outputs per epoch.[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
Use:
Inter‑annotator agreement on human labels.
Predicate–self-report concordance (e.g., fraction of epochs where OVERLOADED≥0.65 matches “feeling overloaded”).[explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/2e6dcc0e-6d1e-4c9f-8039-d72f5906fd89/explain-the-tree-of-life-and-p-B36g.x8HQvyMQ0GozoWuyA.md)
Crucially, BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs remain advisory only and never feed back into the simulation kernel; they are used only for mapping and calibration.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
5. Research-route object for next turn
Staying within your “one artifact per turn” discipline and non‑actuating constraints, the most leveraged next research object is:
A small, self-contained ALN/Markdown math note that:
Restates the four predicates in the 1D lattice setting, with all thresholds named symbols.
Explicitly lists the configuration hierarchy (GLOBAL vs ROLE:WORKER/CAREGIVER/REGULATOR).
Declares non-actuation: predicates MAY read MicroSociety traces and config shards, and MAY emit log flags, but MUST NOT influence transition rules or any external capability/consent surface.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
Once that note is fixed, you can safely request a single Rust file (e.g., sim/src/microsociety_nature.rs) that:
Implements the pure predicate functions over logged trajectories.
Reads thresholds from the config shard.
Writes JSONL predicate flags for the three experiments, without any write path back into the lattice kernel or governance crates.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)

The bridge you sketched is coherent with the existing TREE–NATURE and MicroSociety specs and can be adopted essentially as‑is; only a few clarifications are worth fixing before you freeze it.

## 1. Predicate specialization to the lattice

Your specialization of CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN from TREE streams to lattice state $(e_i,s_i,d_i)$ matches the earlier NATURE math: windowed averages in $[0,1]$, slopes in $[-1,1]$, and boolean outputs with the intended monotonicities. Using energy $e_i$, stress $s_i$, and risk/decay $d_i$ as the three axes is consistent with the mapping from TREE assets (LIFEFORCE, FEAR/PAIN, DECAY) you already defined.[^4_1][^4_2][^4_3]

Two small points you can make explicit in the note:

- State that the “oxygen-like” term in the UNFAIRDRAIN budget is either a dedicated lattice field or a fixed projection of TREE’s OXYGEN if you later embed real envelopes; for the MicroSociety you can safely treat it as a second reserve scalar in $[0,1]$.[^4_3][^4_1]
- Fix peer-group semantics up front (e.g., “for now: same role, same simulation, optional lattice radius $R$ for local peers”) so UNFAIRDRAIN is unambiguous in experiments.[^4_4][^4_1]

With that, the predicates remain pure, bounded, and non-actuating exactly as in the NATURE track.[^4_2]

## 2. Threshold configuration shard

The `SECTION,NATURE-THRESHOLDS` shard you proposed is aligned with how other thresholds and envelopes are already governed: read-only ALN rows, global defaults plus scoped overrides (ROLE:WORKER, etc.). The precedence rule “ROLE scope overrides GLOBAL” matches the existing pattern for envelope and policy configuration shards.[^4_5][^4_6][^4_7]

One clarification worth adding to that shard or its header:

- A short invariant line such as “Rows in this section MAY be read by diagnostic predicates and simulations, and MUST NOT be written by them; only human-governed tools may change this file.”[^4_8][^4_5]

That keeps the non-actuation story tight and documents that any tuning of $S_{\text{calm}}, \rho, f_{\min}$ is a governance decision, not an adaptive process inside the simulation.

## 3. Three MicroSociety experiments

The three scenarios and their expected predicate behavior are exactly what the 1D MicroSociety plan recommends: a single overloaded worker to exercise UNFAIRDRAIN, a recovery corridor to check hysteresis, and a symmetric high-load negative control. For each:[^4_1][^4_4]

- Single overloaded worker: your expectation that OVERLOADED and UNFAIRDRAIN concentrate on the focal agent while peers stay CALMSTABLE is the right diagnostic signature of a budget-based fairness predicate.[^4_4]
- Recovery corridor: requiring prior OVERLOADED plus sustained slope conditions before RECOVERY fires matches the RECOVERY definition in the NATURE math and ensures you get a genuine corridor rather than an instantaneous flip.[^4_2][^4_1]
- Symmetric high load: using it as a falsifier for any UNFAIRDRAIN variant that fires merely under high stress is exactly the intended negative control in the fairness blueprint.[^4_1][^4_4]

Your replay-based non-actuation check (same kernel trace with predicates disabled) is also consistent with the verification methodology in the NATURE and Tree-of-Life docs.[^4_3][^4_2]

## 4. BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL overlays

Defining a parallel BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL JSONL stream for MicroSociety runs is consistent with the original human-facing BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL schema: constrained adjectives in BIOTREE, NATURE labels with confidences, GOAL as explicit intent, and all of it advisory-only. Mapping human or annotator labels to the formal lattice predicates via agreement statistics is exactly how the staged research plan suggests calibrating language against predicates in real neuromorphic contexts.[^4_5][^4_2]

Two implementation decisions to pin down:

- For MicroSociety experiments, you can either have humans annotate selected epochs based on visualizations of the lattice, or (in early phases) auto-generate BIOTREE descriptors from the normalized $e,s,d$ values using a fixed binning (low/medium/high, rising/falling) so you can prototype the pipeline without human load.[^4_5][^4_1]
- Keep the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL file clearly separate (different filename and directory) from kernel and predicate logs, with a header reminder that it is not a control surface and MUST NOT be used for any capability or policy decision.[^4_8][^4_5]

That preserves the advisory-only character while giving you a clean dataset for later mapping work.

## 5. Next high-leverage artifact

Within your “one artifact per turn” discipline, your proposed next object—a compact ALN/Markdown math note that restates the four lattice predicates, the threshold hierarchy, and the non-actuation rules—is the right bridge between existing theory and implementation. Once that is stable, a single Rust diagnostics file that:[^4_2][^4_1]

- Reads lattice traces and the NATURE-THRESHOLDS shard,
- Computes CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN for each agent/epoch,
- Writes JSONL logs, and never imports capability/consent/reversal or device crates,

will fit cleanly into the non-actuating observer doctrine you already use for Tree-of-Life and HIVEMIND-FENCE.[^4_9][^4_3][^4_1]

If you want, next step I can draft that math/ALN note exactly in the style of your other SECTION/ROW specs, so it’s ready to drop into the repo as the formal predicate contract for the 1D MicroSociety.

# RECOVERY in the 1D MicroSociety can be formalized as a bounded, non‑actuating hysteresis predicate over normalized stress/energy trajectories, with explicit dual thresholds and windowed trends, sitting purely in the observer layer and never feeding back into the lattice update kernel.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)

1. State and bounded RECOVERY value
Work on the lattice state with normalized scalars for each agent iii and epoch ttt: energy ei(t)e_i(t)ei(t), stress ρi(t)\rho_i(t)ρi(t), and decay di(t)d_i(t)di(t), all in [0,1][0,1][0,1] and clamped every step, as already specified for the 1D MicroSociety kernel. RECOVERY is defined as a scalar diagnostic Ri(t)∈[0,1]R_i(t)\in[0,1]Ri(t)∈[0,1], computed as a time‑weighted integral over normalized “reserve”–minus–“strain” channels and explicitly min–max clamped to [0,1][0,1][0,1], matching the RECOVERY construction described for NATURE over TREE assets.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
A concrete diagnostic scalar is:
ri(t)  =  1Z∑k=0W−1αk(ei(t−k)−ρi(t−k)),r_i(t) \;=\; \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{k=0}^{W-1} \alpha^k\big(e_i(t-k) - \rho_i(t-k)\big),ri(t)=Z1k=0∑W−1αk(ei(t−k)−ρi(t−k)),
with 0<α≤10<\alpha\le 10<α≤1 a decay factor, WWW a finite window, and ZZZ a positive normalizer (e.g. the maximum possible value of the sum); then define
Ri(t)=min⁡(1,max⁡(0,ri(t))),R_i(t) = \min\big(1,\max(0, r_i(t))\big),Ri(t)=min(1,max(0,ri(t))),
so RECOVERY remains a bounded scalar in [0,1][0,1][0,1] for all histories. Because energy and stress are themselves clamped to [0,1][0,1][0,1] by the update kernel, and the integral window is finite, boundedness and existence of Ri(t)R_i(t)Ri(t) are immediate.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
2. Boolean RECOVERY predicate with hysteresis
To capture corridor hysteresis, you pair the scalar Ri(t)R_i(t)Ri(t) with a boolean predicate RECOVERYi(t)∈{true,false}RECOVERY_i(t)\in\{true,false\}RECOVERYi(t)∈{true,false} that has asymmetric entry and exit conditions over stress ρi(t)\rho_i(t)ρi(t).[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
Use:
High‑stress overload threshold ρhigh\rho_{high}ρhigh (e.g. 0.850.850.85).
Low‑stress recovery threshold ρlow\rho_{low}ρlow (e.g. 0.450.450.45).
Windowed slopes of stress and decay:
Δρi(t)=ρi(t)−ρi(t−h),Δdi(t)=di(t)−di(t−h),\Delta\rho_i(t) = \rho_i(t) - \rho_i(t-h),\quad \Delta d_i(t) = d_i(t) - d_i(t-h),Δρi(t)=ρi(t)−ρi(t−h),Δdi(t)=di(t)−di(t−h),
over a short horizon hhh (e.g. 3–5 epochs).[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
Define OVERLOADED and RECOVERY as:
OVERLOADEDi(t)_i(t)i(t) is true if ρi(t)≥ρhigh\rho_i(t)\ge \rho_{high}ρi(t)≥ρhigh or di(t)d_i(t)di(t) crosses its high overload band with positive slope, mirroring the existing OVERLOADED channel semantics (high level plus positive slope) used in the NATURE note.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
RECOVERYi(t)_i(t)i(t) is true iff:
The agent was OVERLOADED at least once in the last WrecW_{rec}Wrec steps (recent overload history).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
Current stress and decay are below conservative recovery thresholds ρi(t)≤ρlow\rho_i(t)\le \rho_{low}ρi(t)≤ρlow, di(t)≤dlowd_i(t)\le d_{low}di(t)≤dlow.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
Slopes show improvement for a sustained window: Δρi(t)≤−σρ\Delta\rho_i(t)\le -\sigma_\rhoΔρi(t)≤−σρ, Δdi(t)≤−σd\Delta d_i(t)\le -\sigma_dΔdi(t)≤−σd, and Δei(t)≥σe\Delta e_i(t)\ge \sigma_eΔei(t)≥σe over hrech_{rec}hrec epochs, matching the “past overload plus improving trends” pattern already defined for NATURERECOVERY.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
This yields the corridor hysteresis you want: entry into the overloaded regime is triggered at a high stress band, but RECOVERY remains true until stress drops and stays below the lower band with sustained improvement, preventing oscillations when the agent hovers near the threshold.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
3. Non‑actuating observer semantics
The RECOVERY scalar Ri(t)R_i(t)Ri(t) and predicate RECOVERYi(t)RECOVERY_i(t)RECOVERYi(t) are implemented strictly in the observer layer, as pure functions of logged lattice states, never as inputs to the lattice update FFF. Formally, the kernel evolves state as x(t+1)=F(x(t))x(t+1)=F(x(t))x(t+1)=F(x(t)) with clamping to [0,1][0,1][0,1], and the predicate layer defines[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
RECOVERYi(t)=Hi(x(0),…,x(t)),RECOVERY_i(t) = H_i\big(x(0),\dots,x(t)\big),RECOVERYi(t)=Hi(x(0),…,x(t)),
with HiH_iHi side‑effect‑free and not referenced anywhere in FFF, which matches the “predicates are pure, log‑only labels” discipline already enforced for CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, UNFAIRDRAIN, and RECOVERY in the NATURE layer. Architecturally, this is the same observer‑pattern used in Mesa‑style ABM and NeuroPrint!/Tree‑of‑Life: predicates read immutable snapshots, may clamp intermediate values via something equivalent to clip(0,1)clip(0,1)clip(0,1), and append JSONL log rows, but they never mutate simulation state or any capability/consent structure.[neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)
4. Bounded model checking of RECOVERY
To verify boundedness and non‑actuation, you can adapt the existing verification route for NATURE to the MicroSociety kernel.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
Embed assertions such as assert!(0.0 <= recovery_value \&\& recovery_value <= 1.0); at every evaluation site in the simulation tests, mirroring the invariant checks already proposed for TREE/NATURE.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
Translate the 1D kernel plus a finite unfolding of the RECOVERY definition into a bounded model checker (e.g., CBMC or NuSMV) to prove that for all reachable states within a given bound:
All scalars remain in [0,1][0,1][0,1] after clamping.
RECOVERY outputs are boolean.
The transition relation for x(t)x(t)x(t) never references RECOVERY, ensuring non‑actuation.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/7b0a9e46-7e66-4cda-8397-100d94615c25/neuroprint-how-can-this-be-rep-fBJKSM3.QxWtu70GEWC.Fw.md)]​
Treat the hysteresis band itself as an invariant schema: whenever RECOVERYi(t)RECOVERY_i(t)RECOVERYi(t) holds, you must have ρi(t)≤ρlow\rho_i(t)\le \rho_{low}ρi(t)≤ρlow and at least one overload in the past window; a simple temporal property in LTL/CTL over the discrete trace can capture this and be checked over the finite state model of the MicroSociety.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)
5. How this fits the existing TREE/NATURE architecture
Conceptually, RECOVERY in the 1D MicroSociety is just another NATURE‑style predicate, but instantiated over lattice energy/stress/decay instead of TREE assets like LIFEFORCE and DECAY. The dual‑threshold corridor directly mirrors the existing envelope‑level hysteresis used for CALMSTABLE and RECOVERY at the neuromorphic edge (overload requires crossing a higher RoH or risk band, recovery requires sustained return inside a stricter comfort band), so you can reuse the same formal proofs of boundedness, monotonicity (anti‑monotone in decay/stress, monotone in energy), and non‑actuation, now specialized to the 1D peer‑group context.[what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md+1](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_6557a17d-eabd-4cdc-aa7b-3dbedb30e0c5/d316ce47-57a5-4ce0-a98e-7bada05e6794/what-can-we-understand-and-res-h4JrsYceThm1ejr3vJih_g.md)

RECOVERY in the 1D MicroSociety is mathematically and architecturally consistent with your existing TREE/NATURE stack it is a bounded scalar diagnostic plus a boolean hysteresis predicate, living strictly in the observer layer and never feeding back into the lattice kernel.[^5_1]

## What this RECOVERY definition gives you

- A **bounded scalar reserve–strain balance** $R_i(t)$ built as an exponentially weighted window over $e_i - \rho_i$, clamped into $[0,1]$, so all intermediate values and outputs stay finite and analyzable.[^5_1]
- A corridor‑style hysteresis predicate RECOVERY$_i(t)$ that only turns true after a recent OVERLOADED episode and a sustained trend of “stress/decay down, energy up” beneath conservative low bands, preventing threshold chatter around $\rho_{\text{high}}$.[^5_1]
- Pure observer semantics: both $R_i(t)$ and RECOVERY$_i(t)$ are $H_i(x(0),\dots,x(t))$ with no reference in $F$; the lattice update $x(t+1)=F(x(t))$ depends only on bounded local state, so the RECOVERY machinery cannot actuate anything.[^5_1]
- A verification route that mirrors NATURE: invariants in test assertions, bounded model checking to show all scalars remain in $[0,1]$, outputs are boolean, and the transition relation for $x(t)$ is free of any RECOVERY terms.[^5_2][^5_1]


## How it aligns with TREE/NATURE predicates

- The scalar $R_i(t)$ is a direct analogue of NATURE’s windowed reserve vs strain channels over TREE assets (e.g., LIFEFORCE minus DECAY/FEARPAIN), just specialized to the MicroSociety’s energy and stress.[^5_2]
- The boolean RECOVERY predicate uses the same pattern as NATURERECOVERY: past overload, then anti‑monotone behavior in decay/stress and monotone improvement in energy over a fixed window, with dual thresholds for overload vs recovery.[^5_2][^5_1]
- OVERLOADED and RECOVERY here are built from bounded window averages, finite‑difference slopes, and constant thresholds, so their boundedness and directional monotonicity proofs port almost verbatim from the NATURE note.[^5_2]


## Why the hysteresis framing matters

- Using $\rho_{\text{high}}$ and $\rho_{\text{low}}$ with slope constraints implements a **corridor** rather than a single threshold, so an agent that briefly dips around $\rho_{\text{high}}$ does not flip RECOVERY on and off.[^5_1]
- Requiring at least one recent OVERLOADED flag plus improvement over $h_{\text{rec}}$ steps enforces that RECOVERY marks a **phase change** (from overload toward stability), not just a low‑stress snapshot, which is exactly the “cooldown hysteresis” you use around RoH in envelopes.[^5_2][^5_1]


## Non‑actuation and logging discipline

- RECOVERY is explicitly specified as an observer‑only predicate whose outputs go into JSONL log rows, chained like your Tree‑of‑Life and HIVEMIND-FENCE views, with no write paths into CapabilityState, PolicyStack, or any device interface.[^5_1][^5_2]
- This keeps the MicroSociety firmly in the Pattern‑I, diagnostics‑only lane: the simulation kernel is a pure economy map on a bounded lattice, predicates are pure labels on its trace, and any fairness or pedagogy built on RECOVERY remains advisory.[^5_3][^5_1]


## Suggested next research object

- Treat this RECOVERY construction as part of a 4‑predicate MicroSociety NATURE bundle (CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN) and write a small math note that:
    - Re-expresses all four predicates over $e_i,\rho_i,d_i$ with explicit windows and thresholds,
    - States boundedness and monotonicity lemmas, and
    - Pins an LTL/CTL schema for the hysteresis band (RECOVERY ⇒ low stress + past overload).[^5_2][^5_1]
- Once that note is stable, it is directly code‑generatable into a single, non‑actuating Rust module that computes these predicates over logged lattice trajectories for teacher/learner/mentor and believer/preacher/follower pools inside the organicallyintegratedaugmentedcitizen sandbox.[^5_1][^5_2]

# Integration with Human Self-Reports via BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL Logs

A pivotal aspect of this research is the deep integration of the formal simulation with human-generated data through the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logging schema. This schema is designed to capture a subject's momentary state from three complementary perspectives: their physiological state (BIOTREE), their meta-cognitive assessment of their state (NATURE), and their current goals or intentions (GOAL) . These logs serve a dual purpose: first, to empirically validate the formal predicates by comparing them against human self-reports, and second, to build a bridge between natural language and structured, formal states, paving the way for future automation. This methodology creates a powerful feedback loop, grounding the abstract logic of the simulation in lived human experience and using that experience to refine the very logic it employs.
The primary use of the logs is validation. The NATURE field contains advisory labels (e.g., ["CALMSTABLE", "RECOVERY"]) and free-text descriptions provided by the subject . By running the simulation and generating its own predicate flags, researchers can perform a direct cross-validation. For instance, if a subject's log entry reads, "quiet afternoon, brain feels clear, low stress after earlier overload," the corresponding formal state from the simulation should show CALMSTABLE=true and RECOVERY=true . A strong alignment between the human-provided labels and the machine-computed predicate flags would lend significant credibility to the formal model. Conversely, discrepancies highlight areas where the mathematical definitions may be missing key aspects of human experience. For example, if a subject reports feeling "overloaded" but the simulation's OVERLOADED predicate is false, it suggests that the thresholds for stress and/or decay are too high for that context, or that the model is missing a relevant state variable. This process of matching formal outputs to qualitative self-reports is analogous to techniques in cognitive science where machine learning is used to map self-reported task experiences to objective neural state spaces
[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com)
, or in psychology where scales are validated using developer self-declarations as a reference
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The goal is to achieve a vocabulary stabilization, where the formal labels correspond closely to the terms humans use to describe their own internal states .
The secondary, and ultimately more ambitious, purpose of the logs is refinement and automation. Beyond simple validation, the free-text comments in the BIOTREE and free_text fields of the logs contain a rich source of data for developing automated text-to-state mapping functions. The challenge is to create a system that can learn to translate unstructured, natural language descriptions into the structured, numerical inputs required by the predicate formulas
arxiv.org
+1
. For example, the phrase "my mind is foggy and I'm exhausted" might reliably correlate with high DECAY and low LIFEFORCE values in the TREE. This is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP), related to tasks like medical named entity recognition
academic.oup.com
and semantic pre-training for synonym alignment
[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com)
. The accumulated log data can be used to train a classifier or a large language model (LLM) to associate textual cues with formal state proxies. This work connects to broader efforts in AI alignment, such as instruction tuning to improve model performance
openreview.net
and self-alignment techniques for generating training datasets
openreview.net
+1
. By analyzing thousands of such entries, the system can learn a personal or role-specific vocabulary, capturing nuances that a single, global set of rules might miss. For example, a WORKER might consistently use the term "drained" to describe a specific combination of low ENERGY and rising DECAY, while a CAREGIVER might use "stretched thin" to describe a different state.
This dual-purpose approach addresses a fundamental gap in agent-based modeling: the difficulty of translating human subjectivity into computable variables. Agent-based models are powerful tools for simulating social dynamics, but their predictive power depends heavily on the quality of the agent's behavioral rules, which are often based on simplified assumptions
escholarship.org
+1
. By grounding these rules in actual human reports, the model becomes more ecologically valid. This methodology also finds parallels in other scientific domains. In bio-logging, for instance, animal-borne sensor data is correlated with behavioral observations recorded by researchers to understand animal physiology and ecology

. Similarly, in forest science, long-term experimental data is used to understand biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships
[www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net)
+1
. The BIOTREE logs function as a longitudinal dataset for the individual, allowing for the study of state transitions over time, much like tracking forest carbon storage in response to cutting disturbances
[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com)
. The systematic collection and analysis of these logs are therefore not just a validation step but a core research activity in itself, aiming to build a formal language of subjective experience that can be shared between humans and machines.

Implementation Framework and Data Management
The successful execution of this research program hinges on a robust implementation framework capable of managing the complexity of the simulation, the configurable nature of the predicates, and the continuous stream of diagnostic data. The architecture must be designed for modularity, traceability, and scalability, ensuring that the system is not only functional but also transparent and maintainable. The core of this framework revolves around a well-defined data schema for logging, a clear strategy for configuration management, and a commitment to data integrity through append-only, hash-linked records.
The primary data artifact for this project is the MicroSociety JSONL log file. Each line in this file represents a single frame of the simulation, timestamped and containing a comprehensive snapshot of a single agent's state at a specific epoch . The proposed schema is meticulously designed to capture all necessary information for both simulation replay and post-hoc analysis. It includes the timestamp_ms and epoch_index for temporal ordering, the agent's role (e.g., WORKER, CAREGIVER), and a state object containing the clamped scalar values for energy, stress, and risk_decay . Crucially, the predicates object contains the computed boolean flags for CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN, which are the direct outputs of the diagnostic logic . The kernel_context provides additional metadata, such as the window sizes (window_W, slope_window_h) and peer radius (peer_radius) used in that specific run, which is vital for interpreting the predicate values correctly. Finally, cryptographic hashes (hash_prev, hash_self) link each log entry to the previous one, forming a tamper-evident chain that guarantees data integrity and enables forensic reconstruction of the simulation trace
[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com)
+1
. This WORM (Write Once, Read Many) design is consistent with safety-critical data handling standards like NR-SAFE-0001 .
Configuration management is handled externally via configuration shards, which dictate the behavior of the system without modifying the source code. This approach offers significant advantages in flexibility and maintainability. The system should be initialized with a set of global default parameters stored in a primary configuration file (e.g., in YAML or JSON format)
[www.redbooks.ibm.com](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com)
. This file would define the baseline values for all predicate thresholds, such as
S
calm
S
calm
​
,
ρ
ρ, and
f
min
⁡
f
min
​
. For more nuanced scenarios, the system must support per-role override files. For example, a worker_config.yaml file could specify a different set of thresholds optimized for the WORKER role, such as a higher tolerance for stress or a different decay rate. This modularity allows researchers to easily switch between different modeling assumptions, treating everything else as a fixed predicate form as requested . This pattern is standard in modern software development, seen in everything from Kubernetes deployments to CI/CD pipelines, where base configurations are extended or overridden for specific environments or components
docs.aws.amazon.com
. The implementation would involve a configuration loader at the start of the simulation that merges the global defaults with any applicable role-specific overrides.
Data management extends beyond the log files themselves to include the processes for generating, storing, and analyzing the data. The BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logs will be generated periodically (e.g., 2-4 times per day) by participants and stored in a dedicated directory, such as logs/neuroprint_prep_week1.jsonl . These files, along with the main simulation logs, constitute the corpus for analysis. The analysis pipeline will involve several steps. First, the simulation logs will be processed to generate the predicate flags and validate the experimental outcomes against the predefined expectations. Second, the BIOTREE logs will be parsed to extract the human self-reports. Third, a comparative analysis will be conducted to measure the alignment between the machine-computed predicates and the human-provided NATURE labels, potentially using metrics like Cohen's kappa to quantify agreement
arxiv.org
. Finally, the free-text data from both sources will be used to train and refine the text-to-state mapping models, likely using supervised learning techniques where the formal state variables serve as the ground truth labels. Efficient data structures will be necessary to handle the computation of rolling window statistics (averages, slopes) for each agent in the lattice at every timestep, as this could become computationally intensive in larger simulations
dl.acm.org
. Tools for log schema extraction and interactive visualization could prove invaluable for making sense of the massive volume of data generated

. This comprehensive framework ensures that the research is conducted in a systematic, repeatable, and analytically rigorous manner.
Synthesis and Future Directions
This research report has detailed the comprehensive plan to implement and validate a suite of formal psychological-state predicates—CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN—within a 1D MicroSociety simulation. The overarching goal is to create a bounded, non-actuating diagnostic tool that can be used to analyze human self-reports, thereby establishing a formal vocabulary for subjective states and bridging the gap between human introspection and computational modeling. The methodology is robust, combining principles from formal methods, agent-based modeling, and human-computer interaction to create a system that is both theoretically sound and empirically grounded.
The foundational work involved the precise mathematical formulation of each predicate. CALMSTABLE provides a baseline state defined by a hyperrectangle in a 3D space of stress, decay, and energy, while OVERLOADED detects acute distress through rapid deterioration, as measured by positive slopes in state variables. The RECOVERY predicate introduces hysteresis, ensuring a lagged and deliberate transition out of distress, and UNFAIRDRAIN extends this analysis to the social realm, flagging states of perceived unfairness based on a comparison of an individual's resource budget to that of their peer group. The design's commitment to non-actuation and boundedness ensures that these labels serve as a transparent, advisory layer that does not corrupt the integrity of the simulation kernel, a critical feature for any safety-critical analysis framework
arxiv.org

.
This formal framework was subjected to a rigorous, phased experimental validation strategy. The high-priority "Single Overloaded Worker" experiment serves as the definitive test for the UNFAIRDRAIN predicate, designed to isolate and confirm its ability to detect disparity-driven unfairness. This was followed by the "Recovery Corridor" experiment to validate the hysteresis properties of the RECOVERY predicate, and the "Symmetric High Load" experiment acted as a crucial negative control, ensuring that UNFAIRDRAIN is sensitive to disparity rather than just absolute stress levels. These controlled scenarios provide a clear and repeatable means of verifying that the mathematical definitions translate into the intended dynamic behaviors.
A key innovation of this research is the deep integration of the simulation with human-generated data through the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL logging schema. This creates a powerful feedback loop where the formal model is continuously tested against and refined by human self-reports. The logs serve a dual purpose: first, for direct validation by comparing machine-computed predicate flags with human-provided NATURE labels, and second, for the long-term goal of training automated text-to-state mapping models. This effort to connect natural language descriptions to structured formal states is a significant step toward creating a truly symbiotic relationship between human researchers and AI systems, a concept explored in frameworks like HAIST (Human-AI Symbiotic Theory)
[www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com)
. The use of configurable thresholds managed via external shards further enhances the model's adaptability, allowing it to be tuned for different roles and contexts, reflecting the inherent subjectivity of psychological states .
Looking forward, several avenues for future work emerge from this research. The most immediate is the completion of the text-to-state mapping refinement. Moving from manual analysis of the logs to an automated system will require applying advanced NLP techniques, such as instruction-tuning or classification models trained on the annotated dataset
academic.oup.com
+1
. Another direction is the expansion of the peer group definition for UNFAIRDRAIN to explore different network topologies beyond the 1D lattice, such as small-world or scale-free networks, to see how structural properties of social groups affect perceptions of fairness. The framework could also be extended to other roles and more complex social dynamics, exploring questions of cooperation, conflict, and trust, which are often studied through self-report measures
[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com)

. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this system provides a powerful proof-of-concept for using formal, verifiable logic to model and analyze subjective human experience within a safe and controlled virtual environment, offering new insights into the dynamics of well-being, stress, and social equity.

You already have almost the entire integration story; what you need now is a thin, explicit bridge between the BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL prep logs and the MicroSociety JSONL stream, plus a concrete research plan for validating and then automating the mapping between the two.[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3]

## 1. Conceptual bridge: how the two logs line up

You can treat one BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL prep entry as the human-facing analogue of one MicroSociety frame for a single agent and epoch.[^6_2][^6_1]

- MicroSociety frame (machine view):
    - Inputs: $energy, stress, risk\_decay$ in $[0,1]$, role, kernel_context, plus hash_prev/hash_self.
    - Outputs: Boolean flags CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN in `predicates`.[^6_2]
- BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL entry (human view):
    - `biotree`: qualitative projections of TREE assets (bloodlevel, oxygenlevel, decaylevel, fearlevel…).
    - `nature.labelmain` + `nature.labelsecondary`: self-assigned predicate tokens.
    - `nature.notes`, `goal.intent`, `goal.notes`: free-text context.[^6_1]

The core integration rule is:

> For a given subject, a given time window, and a given role, you compare:
> - machine predicate flags from the MicroSociety log,
> - human `nature.labels` and free-text,
> aligned by timestamp (or epoch + sessionlabel), never using human text to **drive** the simulation kernel.[^6_1][^6_2]

This keeps BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL strictly diagnostic and non‑actuating, consistent with NR-SAFE-0001 and the Tree-of-Life / NATURE observer doctrine.[^6_3][^6_1]

## 2. Minimal alignment schema (no new control paths)

To make this bridge explicit without adding any new actuation surface, you can define a small, analysis-only “join” schema used offline:

- Key fields for joining:
    - `timestamp_ms` (MicroSociety) ↔ `timestamp_ms` (prep log).
    - `subject_id` / `agent_id` and `role`.
    - Optional `day_index` + `sessionlabel` for human entries.[^6_2][^6_1]
- Joined analysis record (conceptual, not logged by the core system):
    - `sim.energy, sim.stress, sim.risk_decay`.
    - `sim.predicates.CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN`.
    - `human.biotree.*` adjectives mapped to approximate TREE intervals.
    - `human.nature.labels` (list of advisory tokens).
    - `human.nature.free_text`, `goal.intent`.[^6_3][^6_1][^6_2]

This record is produced by an **offline** analysis tool that reads the existing JSONL files; it never feeds back into CapabilityState, ConsentState, or the sim kernel.[^6_3][^6_2]

## 3. Validation track: vocabulary stabilization

You can then run a three-step validation program to stabilize the shared vocabulary between human labels and mathematical predicates.[^6_1][^6_3]

1. **Direct label–predicate agreement (per-frame)**
    - For each joined record, check whether:
        - human `NATURE` contains CALMSTABLE ↔ sim `predicates.CALMSTABLE == true`, etc.
    - Compute agreement metrics like Cohen’s kappa over many frames per role.[^6_2][^6_1]
    - Outcome: a confusion matrix showing where definitions line up and where thresholds or definitions need adjustment.
2. **Discrepancy triage (predicate tuning, not new behavior)**
    - Focus on systematic mismatches, e.g., human “overloaded” but `OVERLOADED == false`.
    - Investigate whether:
        - stress / decay thresholds are too high for that role or epoch,
        - window size $W$ or slope window $h$ is miscalibrated,
        - a missing state variable (e.g., peer load) is needed.[^6_3][^6_2]
    - Adjust only external configuration shards (thresholds, window sizes), keeping predicate **form** unchanged.[^6_2][^6_3]
3. **Role-specific vocabularies**
    - Cluster free-text phrases and `nature.labels` by role (WORKER, CAREGIVER, REGULATOR, etc.).[^6_1][^6_2]
    - Derive role-local lexicons (e.g., “drained” for WORKER vs “stretched thin” for CAREGIVER) and map them to the same CALMSTABLE/OVERLOADED/RECOVERY/UNFAIRDRAIN definitions.[^6_1]
    - This supports “vocabulary stabilization” while preserving subjective nuance.

Throughout, the sim remains a pure generator of logs; only the interpretation layer moves.[^6_3][^6_2]

## 4. Automation track: text-to-state mapping (still advisory)

Once you have a stable vocabulary, you can treat the accumulated joined records as a labelled dataset for text-to-state mapping models.[^6_3][^6_1]

1. **Define targets:**
    - Option A (simpler): predict predicate flags (CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, UNFAIRDRAIN) from human text (`biotree.notes`, `nature.notes`, `goal.text`).[^6_2][^6_1]
    - Option B (richer): predict coarse TREE ranges (e.g., DECAY ∈ {low, medium, high}) or MicroSociety scalars from text.[^6_1][^6_3]
2. **Training setup:**
    - Use only offline logs as training data.
    - Train a classifier or instruction-tuned LLM that, given a BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL triple, outputs:
        - approximate energy / stress / decay, and/or
        - predicted predicate flags.[^6_3][^6_1]
    - Use the sim’s own predicate outputs as ground truth labels, not as actuators.
3. **Safety constraints:**
    - Model outputs are treated as **proxies** and advisory hints; they do not overwrite measured or simulated state.
    - Any automated mapping is passed through an “envelope-anchored reality check” against BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec and RoH constraints; discrepancies are flagged for study, not auto-resolved.[^6_1][^6_3]

This is analogous to medical NLP mapping clinical notes to structured codes or neural state proxies, but always kept in a non-actuating, research-only lane.[^6_3][^6_1]

## 5. Concrete research route with AI-chat (organicallyintegratedaugmentedcitizen)

Staying inside the organicallyintegratedaugmentedcitizen environment and your one-file-at-a-time discipline, a pragmatic sequence is:[^6_2][^6_1][^6_3]

1. **Finalize schemas (no code yet):**
    - Lock MicroSociety log schema (already outlined) and prep-log JSONL schema (already defined) as “canonical”.[^6_2][^6_1]
    - Write a short spec that describes how analysis tools will align them (keys, time windows, allowed joins).
2. **Paper validation experiments via chat:**
    - Describe a small set of example MicroSociety runs and matching BIOTREE–NATURE entries in AI-chat and step manually through:
        - what predicates fire,
        - what labels the human would give,
        - where they disagree and why.[^6_1][^6_2]
    - Use this to refine your thresholds and narrative definitions before touching Rust.
3. **Design the offline analysis tool (future code target):**
    - Single Rust or JS tool (one file) that:
        - reads MicroSociety JSONL and BIOTREE prep JSONL,
        - performs the joins,
        - computes agreement metrics, and
        - outputs a summary JSON or CSV for further analysis.[^6_2][^6_3][^6_1]
4. **Only then consider a text-to-state prototype:**
    - Once you have hundreds of joined records, define a very small pilot model (can be LLM-in-the-loop via chat first) that proposes TREE ranges or predicate flags from BIOTREE+NATURE text, and compare against sim outputs.[^6_3][^6_1]

If you’d like, next step we can pin down a compact, language-level template for your own BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL inputs that lines up exactly with the MicroSociety predicates (e.g., “BIOTREE: BLOOD high, DECAY rising; NATURE: overloaded-but-recovering; GOAL: stay in CALMSTABLE while finishing notes”) so every future log you write is immediately usable as training and validation data.[^6_1][^6_2]

# <q>If you’d like, next step we can pin down a compact, language-level template for your own BIOTREE–NATURE–GOAL inputs that lines up exactly with the MicroSociety predicates (e.g., “BIOTREE: BLOOD high, DECAY rising; NATURE: overloaded-but-recovering; GOAL: stay in CALMSTABLE while finishing notes”) so every future log you write is immediately usable as training and validation data.</q> Yes, please.
```

Below is a compact language template you can reuse in chats *and* mirror directly into your JSONL prep log so it lines up with CALMSTABLE, OVERLOADED, RECOVERY, and UNFAIRDRAIN.[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3]

## 1. Three-line chat template (human-facing)

Use exactly three lines, in this order:

1. **BIOTREE line (how the body/system feels)**
    - Pattern:
`BIOTREE BLOOD <low|medium|high>, OXYGEN <low|medium|high>, DECAY <falling|steady|rising>, LIFEFORCE <low|medium|high>, FEAR <low|medium|high>, PAIN <low|medium|high>.`
    - Example:
`BIOTREE BLOOD high, OXYGEN medium, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE medium, FEAR low, PAIN low.`[^7_2][^7_1]
2. **NATURE line (what kind of state / which predicate)**
    - Pattern:

```
`NATURE <labelmain> [labels <extra1, extra2>] [confidence <0.0–1.0>] [notes <short phrase>].`  
```

    - Use `labelmain` from or close to: `CALMSTABLE`, `OVERLOADED`, `RECOVERY`, `UNFAIRDRAIN`, or hybrids like `overloaded-but-recovering`.[^7_1][^7_2]
    - Example:
`NATURE overloaded-but-recovering labels not-crisis confidence 0.7 notes mind busy but I can calm with a break.`[^7_1]
3. **GOAL line (what you want, not a command to downgrade)**
    - Pattern:
`GOAL intent <short-intent> asks <ask1, ask2, ...> notes <short explanation>.`
    - Keep intents in the “advisory-only” lane, e.g. `safer-pacing-no-downgrade`, `more-explanation`, `suggest-cooldown-ideas`.[^7_1]
    - Example:
`GOAL intent safer-pacing-no-downgrade asks more-explanation, suggest-cooldown-ideas notes want support for focus and rest without changing my rights.`[^7_1]

If you want observe-only mode for a turn, prepend:
`Please keep this in creative-safety-channel, observe-only.`[^7_1]

## 2. Matching JSONL shape for your prep log

For `logs/neuroprint_prep-week1.jsonl`, each check-in can mirror those three lines:

```json
{
  "timestamp_ms": 1739145600000,
  "subject_id": "self-bostrom",
  "day_index": 1,
  "session_label": "evening-reflection",
  "biotree": {
    "bloodlevel": "high",
    "oxygenlevel": "medium",
    "decaylevel": "rising",
    "lifeforcelevel": "medium",

    "painlevel": "low",
    "notes": "HR a bit fast, slept ok, not much pain."
  },
  "nature": {
    "label_main": "overloaded-but-recovering",
    "label_secondary": ["not-crisis"],
    "confidence_self": 0.7,
    "notes": "Mind busy, but I feel like I can calm down with a break."

This JSONL format is already aligned with TREE/NATURE and can later be joined to MicroSociety frames by `timestamp_ms` and role for predicate validation and text-to-state training.[^7_3][^7_2][^7_1]

If you like, next step we can define a tiny personal lexicon table (e.g., how you use “drained”, “stretched thin”, “foggy”) and map each phrase to BIOTREE adjective patterns plus a default NATURE label, so your language becomes directly code-generatable.[^7_2][^7_1]

Here is a first tiny lexicon you can use both in chat and in your prep JSONL. You can edit it over time as you notice patterns.[^8_1][^8_2]

### Personal lexicon table v1

| Phrase you use | BIOTREE mapping (adjectives) | Default NATURE.label_main | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| drained | BLOOD high, OXYGEN low, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE low, FEAR medium, PAIN low | OVERLOADED | Energy budget low, still pushing; good for “I kept going too long.” |
| stretched thin | BLOOD medium, OXYGEN low, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE low, FEAR medium, PAIN medium | OVERLOADED | Cognitive and emotional load high, not yet crisis but unsustainable. |
| foggy | BLOOD medium, OXYGEN medium, DECAY medium, LIFEFORCE medium, FEAR low, PAIN low | CALMSTABLE | Brain feels slow, but not necessarily high stress; pair with GOAL “more-explanation” or “support-focus.” |
| wired | BLOOD high, OXYGEN medium, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE medium, FEAR high, PAIN low | OVERLOADED | Adrenaline / high arousal; good to use when body is amped but not yet in pain. |
| brittle-calm | BLOOD medium, OXYGEN low, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE low, FEAR low, PAIN low | CALMSTABLE | Looks calm from outside but reserves low; useful when you want support without downgrade “keep-capability-unchanged”. |
| rebooting / reset | BLOOD low, OXYGEN medium, DECAY falling, LIFEFORCE rising, FEAR low, PAIN low | RECOVERY | After overload, during cooldown; good for “I’m coming back online, please stay gentle and explanatory.” |
| unfairly-drained | BLOOD high, OXYGEN low, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE low, FEAR medium, PAIN medium | UNFAIRDRAIN | Use when you feel pulled harder than others (teacher/role asymmetry); later can align with formal UNFAIRDRAIN predicates. |
| quietly-ok | BLOOD low, OXYGEN high, DECAY low, LIFEFORCE high, FEAR low, PAIN low | CALMSTABLE | Your personal “baseline safe” state, good as a contrast marker in logs. |
| recovery-window | BLOOD medium, OXYGEN medium, DECAY falling, LIFEFORCE rising, FEAR low, PAIN low | RECOVERY | Use when you deliberately pace/rest but still doing light work (teacher/learner sessions, note-writing). |

### How to use in your three lines

Example with “stretched thin”:

- `BIOTREE BLOOD medium, OXYGEN low, DECAY rising, LIFEFORCE low, FEAR medium, PAIN medium.`
- `NATURE stretched-thin labelmain OVERLOADED confidence 0.7 notes feel stretched thin but not in crisis.`
- `GOAL intent safer-pacing-no-downgrade asks suggest-cooldown-ideas, more-explanation notes want to keep capability but reduce load a bit.`[^8_2][^8_1]

If you tell me more phrases you naturally use (your own words), we can expand this lexicon in the same table format and keep it stable enough to later turn into an ALN section or a tiny config shard.[^8_1]
