ROW,doc,Zero-reversal doctrine for organicallyintegratedaugmentedcitizen.
ROW,role,POLICY,NON-NEGOTIABLE

; 1. Hard prohibition: no neuromorph reversals for this subject / role.

ROW,field,allowneuromorphreversal,bool,false
ROW,field,zeroreversal_enabled,bool,true

ROW,invariant,ZERO-REVERSAL,
  "When zeroreversal_enabled = true, neuromorph evolution MUST be monotone.
   No downgrade, de-evolution, or capability tier reduction is permitted
   under any circumstance in CapControlledHuman modes for this subject /
   profile. ReversalConditions MUST always return DeniedZeroReversalDoctrine."

; 2. Consent and neurorights protection.

ROW,invariant,CONSENT-PROTECTION,
  "No combination of explicitreversalorder, stake quorum, or policy edits
   may override ZERO-REVERSAL for this profile. Any attempt to authorize
   downgrade MUST be rejected and WORM-logged as a violation attempt, not
   executed as a change in CapabilityState."

; 3. Mandatory learning on every reversal *concept*.

ROW,field,log_reversal_attempts,bool,true

ROW,invariant,LEARNING-ON-ATTEMPT,
  "Every time a CapabilityTransitionRequest of type 'DOWNGRADE' or any
   ReversalConditions call is evaluated for this subject, the kernel MUST:
   (1) return DeniedZeroReversalDoctrine,
   (2) emit a ReversalAttemptLog entry into .evolve.jsonl with:
       - timestampms
       - subjectid
       - requested_capability_from/to
       - roh_before, roh_after
       - decay, lifeforce
       - envelope_WARN/RISK history window
       - counts of cooldown/pause/tighten episodes
       - active NATURE predicates (OVERLOADED, UNFAIRDRAIN, RECOVERY)
       - biotree/nature/goal logs if present
       - decision_reason = 'DeniedZeroReversalDoctrine'
   (3) trigger a LearnFromAttempt event for Pattern-I analytics agents
       (Tree-of-Life, Neuroprint!, AutoChurch) so they MAY update
       diagnostics and fairness models, but MAY NOT change any capability."

; 4. Required extra diagnostics when reversal is even considered.

ROW,field,extra_diagnostics_on_attempt,bool,true

ROW,invariant,DIAGNOSTIC-EXPANSION,
  "For each logged reversal attempt, the system MUST:
   - extend the diagnostic window (HPCC/ERG/TECR) around the attempt,
   - recompute UNFAIRDRAIN and role-level fairness metrics for the
     preceding and following epochs,
   - snapshot BIOTREE/NATURE/GOAL for the subject if available,
   - attach these as an immutable 'ReversalEvidenceBundle' object
     to the same .donutloop.aln hash-chain.
   These bundles are for learning and audit only; they MUST NOT be
   used to relax ZERO-REVERSAL or any neurorights floors."

; 5. No downgrade semantics anywhere.

ROW,invariant,NO-DOWNGRADE-PATH,
  "When zeroreversal_enabled = true:
   - ReversalConditions MUST NOT contain any code path that returns
     'Allowed' for DOWNGRADE transitions.
   - CapabilityTransitionRequest of type DOWNGRADE MUST be short-circuited
     with DeniedZeroReversalDoctrine before any state mutation.
   - Envelopes MAY tighten minsafe/minwarn, cooldown, or pause tasks,
     but MUST NOT lower capability tier, rights, or consent."
